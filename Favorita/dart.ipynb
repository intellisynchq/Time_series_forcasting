    "* Incorporate weather data.\n",
    "* Reduce/prioritize features to avoid certain features being overwhelmingly powerful or having outsized interactions on the predictions. (Regularization and other strategies can also be considered.)\n",
    "* Incorporate improved model tuning, the current notebook takes a very long time to run and although the results are good, some of my other notebooks run faster with better results. The hope was that with a larger number of features and increased training that the notebook could reach a level of grokking but that did not occur. **Highly suggest pulling in weather data as well.**"
